In November 2010 Chiseldon Football Club achieved prestigious FA Charter Standard Development Club status, confirming the club as one of the best run and forward thinking clubs in the county.

The FA Charter Standard scheme is a best practice guide that sets standards of coaching, administration and child protection for all clubs outside the Football League and Premier League. It also recognises the clubâ€™s commitment to coaching, player and coach development and the raising of standards of behavior in the game. Further information about the FA Charter Standard scheme can be found at thefa.com/charterstandard

As part of the FA Charter Standard Development Club application, the club has created a five year development plan to ensure the ongoing growth and progress on and off the pitch. Within the development plan are targets to: -

- Raise the profile of the club within the local and wider communities
- Introduce new teams each season; providing safe, secure football for all
- Recruit managers, coaches and committee members enabling future club growth
- Ensure the ongoing training and development of all club members
- Continue work to develop existing/new facilities
